# Dotnet Examples
Portfolio of .NET applications showcasing key tech stacks and patterns.

- [x] **WPF**: Desktop app for flight data management using MVVM, SQLite, and Entity Framework.
- [x] **Service**: Background worker fetching weather data.
- [x] **ASP.NET MVC**: Web app for flight, carrier, and pier CRUD with SQLite backend.
- [x] **ASP.NET WEB API**: REST API for flight data CRUD, documented with Scalar.
- [ ] **MAUI**: Mobile app for cross-platform flight data viewing
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Tests for core logic using xUnit or MSTest
- [ ] **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments

## Tech Stack
.NET Core, C#, SQLite, Entity Framework (EF Core), Serilog, MVVM, OOP, Rest

## Future Plans
- authentication & security (JWT and MSFT Identity)
- localization
- packaging (nuget or github)

*Under Consideration*
- TCP (an app with TCP Server/Client comms, byte parsing, etc..)
- Azure (live deploy, azure functions, identity, etc..)
- WinForms (with .net framework as example of legacy support)
- SQL Server (sqlite is easier to run, but full sql server allows me to shocase propper SPs, indexing, etc..)
- ASP.NET Blazor WASM (Web app for flight, carrier, and pier CRUD with ASP.NET backend)
- WinUI 3
