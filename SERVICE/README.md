# WFS
Weather Fetch Service

This service is intended to show concurrency and threading. Thus, lots of hardcoded options for hardcoding data are used, as it is not intended to be a full open-meteo implementation.


This project uses https://open-meteo.com/ for its data.
A small amount of data is polled every 30 seconds. For politeness mainly.
